      </h1>
      <div>
        Write a function which trims multiple zero's sequences to a single zero digit. the return value is the updated array. <br>
        YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE ANOTHER ARRAY, and you need to implement it with one pass over the array. <br>
        in other words, each element in the array should change its index only once during the program.<br><br>

        const arr = [1,2,0,0,0,0,5,7,-6,0,8,0] var n = zeroTrim(arr);<br>
        <br>
        console.log(n) // PRINT: 1,2,0,5,7,-6,0,8,0]<br> BEST IMPLEMENTATION SHOULD BE IN COMPLEXITY OF O(n) i.e , with one pass over the array.
